# Simple Frequency-Equalizer

## The project involved creating a frequency equalizer, i.e. a tool that allows the signal to be amplified or attenuated in individual subbands.
The project was made using filter banks (synthesis and analysis). A prototype filter compatible with the MPEG audio compression standard was also used.
